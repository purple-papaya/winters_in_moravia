# Winters in South Moravia, Czechia: a Personal Anecdote of Climate Change

My little hometown of approx. 5,000 people makes major news in Czechia once a year. It's not because of tourists visiting the International Folklore Festival and not because of great wine, grown on sunny hills in the lowland. Located in rural South Moravia, the record of maximum summer temperature is broken here on a yearly basis. It's scorching hot, with little to no precipitation (particularly in recent years). In fact, locals call it 'the dry corner' in native dialect. Throughout the years, I've been witnessing the effects of climate change on local weather. It's not just the summer temperature, but also the summer storms got more extreme. In 2021, an F4 tornado ended its destructive journey just 10 kilometres from my hometown, leaving thousands homeless and damaged infrastructure behind. Here follows a personal account of observations on disappearing winters, backed up by data from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
